> A DAW for the 21st century! 

## About
`Vusic` was initially developed as part of the `ENGG 4000` (`Senior Design Project`) course at [UNB](http://unb.ca/) that began in Fall of 2018 but is now just a side project. It uses Vue, TypeScript and Electron and strives (although currently fails) to offer the same functionality of DAWs such as FL Studio and Abelton.

## Acknowledgements
[GridSound](https://gridsound.com) was a great reference during development. For example, components such as `Timeline.vue` and `BeatLines.vue` were based off similar component implementations from [gs-ui-components](https://github.com/gridsound/gs-ui-components).

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was also used as a reference during development. We are big fans of the structure and navigation tools (Shortcuts, Command Palette, etc) and wanted to implement similar features within `Vusic`.
